# Final calculator if you worry about whether you pass or fail the course you took

If you want to know what score you should at least get from the finals in order to pass the course, here is a finalGradeCalculator program which calculates and returns a minimum score to pass the course based on your midterm exam result you input in. Pretty basic and easy project but I think most of us spends a certain time in order to calculate what score we should get in the finals in order to pass the course. It is written in C++, could have been done in python with an ease. This only works for particular Ankara University departments.( Midterm %30, Final %80)

Input your course name (Note: I highly not recommend putting empty space between the words like "Quantum Mechanics". It just goes crazy for a reason I do not know. I found it super hard detecting empty spaces in a string array so left it like that. Just type like I did in the above image.)

Here is all the different final scores that you should get so as to get corresponding grade (C3,C2,C1,B3,B2,B1,A,A+)


## How to use?


1. Run the program and input your course
2. Input the particular course's midterm result
3. Repeat this until you input all the courses you want to get information about.
4. When you are done with the inputting, you can write "bitir" to the console to commence calculating.
